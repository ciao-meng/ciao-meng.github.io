Welcome to Xiaomeng Chenâ€™s website! I am currently a second year graduate student from [School of Electronic and Information Engineering](http://eie.hitsz.edu.cn/), [Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen](https://www.hitsz.edu.cn/). In HITSZ, my research is supervised by [Prof. Shaohua Wu](https://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/wushaohua), Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen. My research interest includes advanced channel coding techniques, wireless communications and information theory. 

You can find my CV here: [Xiaomeng Chen's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).

Research Interest
======
1. Advanced Channel Coding Techniques.  Performance analysis of channel coding in the Finite Block-Length (FBL) regime. Myresearch work about FBL analysis of Spinal codes has been published in IEEE proc. ISIT, IEEE Trans. Commun., and submitted to IEEE Trans. Wirel. Commun. and IEEE Trans. Veh. Technol.
2. Goal-oriented Communications and Information Timeliness. Goal-oriented and semantic communications, with a specific interest in evaluating the significance and value of sampled data packets to enhance goal completion. Myresearch work about optimal sampling policy to minimize Uncertainty-of-Information (an AoI-related indicator) has been published in IEEE proc. ITW, and submitted to IEEE/ACM Trans. Netw.
3. Information Theory and Wireless Communications. Fundamental knowledge and experiments have been applied in every research work. Related projects are shown as follows, and code is displayed on github.
